# Data-Mining-Project
In this project, pre-processing was done on climate data. This pre-processing included feature selection using decision tree, data standardization, resampling, one-hot encoding, label encoding, removal of outliers, and visualization. Finally, the pre-processed data were given to SVM, KNN, and decision tree models, and the models were evaluated.
